Introduction
Write an application that takes numeric input (N) from a user and outputs a multiplication table of (N) prime numbers. This should not take you more than a couple of hours. But the aim is NOT to see how much you can code in a given time, so feel free to spend as much time as you want to highlight your level of coding.

The requirements:
1. This exercise must be written in either C# .NET, PHP or Java
2. Write your application with high unit test coverage
3. For the input and output you can use the console, a web page, or something else
4. Please write an algorithm to solve the prime number generation - do not use a library method to generate your primes
5. The user should input a whole number N, where is N is at least 1
6. The application should output an N+1 x N+1 grid of numbers
